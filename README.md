# To-Do List App
This is a simple to-do list app with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can add tasks to the list and delete them.


# Features
- Add new tasks to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Delete tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task title.
- All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even if you close or refresh the page.

# Style
The colors where based on a blue pastel colors palette.

# How it Works
The app uses event listeners to handle user input, and updates the list dynamically using the DOM Api. Tasks are stored in an array, which is saved to local storage using JSON.stringify. When the page is reloaded, the list is rebuilt dynamically, based on the local storage.

# Languages
This app is build using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
